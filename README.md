This is a Firefox port of [open-claude-in-chrome](https://github.com/noemica-io/open-claude-in-chrome), a clean-room reimplementation of Anthropic's [Claude in Chrome](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/chrome) extension. It gives Claude Code (and Claude Desktop) full browser automation via 18 MCP tools, without any domain restrictions, running in Firefox instead of Chromium.

## What's Different

| | Claude in Chrome (official) | Open Claude in Firefox |
|---|---|---|
| **Domain blocklist** | 58 blocked domains across 11 categories | No blocklist. Navigate anywhere. |
| **Safety prompts** | Per-site permission, plan approval, high-risk confirmation | Same model, on by default, each switchable in Settings ([details](#security-model)) |
| **Browser** | Chrome and Edge only | Firefox |
| **Source code** | Closed source | Open source (MIT) |
| **Tools** | 18 MCP tools | Same 18 MCP tools |
| **Automation method** | Chrome DevTools Protocol (CDP) | Firefox WebExtension APIs |

### Blocked Domains in the Official Extension

| Category | Blocked Sites |
|----------|--------------|
| Banking | Chase, BofA, Wells Fargo, Citibank |
| Investing/Brokerage | Schwab, Fidelity, Robinhood, E-Trade, Wealthfront, Betterment |
| Payments/Transfers | PayPal, Venmo, Cash App, Zelle, Stripe, Square, Wise, Western Union, MoneyGram, Adyen, Checkout.com |
| BNPL | Klarna, Affirm, Afterpay |
| Neobanks/Fintech | SoFi, Chime, Mercury, Brex, Ramp |
| Crypto | Coinbase, Binance, Kraken, MetaMask |
| Gambling | DraftKings, FanDuel, Bet365, Bovada, PokerStars, BetMGM, Caesars |

| Adult | Pornhub, XVideos, XNXX |
| News/Media | NYT, WSJ, Barron's, MarketWatch, Bloomberg, Reuters, Economist, Wired, Vogue |
| Social Media | Reddit |

Open Claude in Firefox has **none of these restrictions**. It does keep the official extension's *consent* model: Claude asks before using a new site and before high-risk actions. See [Security model](#security-model).

## Architecture

```
Claude Code / Claude Desktop <--stdio MCP--> mcp-server.js <--TCP--> native-host.js <--native messaging--> Extension <--> Firefox
```

Three components:
1. **Extension** — Manifest V3 using Firefox WebExtension APIs (screenshots via `captureVisibleTab`, input via content script synthetic events, JS eval via `scripting.executeScript`)
2. **MCP Server** — Node.js process started by Claude Code or Claude Desktop, exposes tools via MCP
3. **Native Messaging Host** — Bridge between the MCP server and the extension

The TCP link listens on `127.0.0.1` only, and every connection must authenticate (see [Security model](#security-model)).

## Security model

This follows the official Claude in Chrome safety design, minus the domain blocklist. All protections are **on by default**; each can be turned off in the extension's Settings page (`about:addons` → Claude MCP → Preferences).

| Protection | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Site permissions** | The first time Claude opens, reads, or acts on a site, a dialog asks you to **Deny**, **Allow for this session**, or **Always allow this site**. Approvals are per exact host (`www.` is treated as the same host). Session approvals are cleared when Firefox restarts; always-allowed sites can be removed in Settings. |
| **Plan approval** | `update_plan` opens a dialog listing the domains and approach. Approving it allows those domains *and their subdomains* for the session. Rejecting it tells Claude to stop and ask you. |
| **High-risk confirmation** | Before Claude clicks something that submits a form or looks like buy / pay / checkout / delete / send / confirm / transfer / publish / share (English and Chinese keywords), presses Enter in a form, or types into a password or payment field, you're asked to **Allow once** or **Deny**. `javascript_tool` always asks (with an option to allow it on that site for the session). |
| **Claude's tabs only** | Claude can only control tabs it created, plus tabs those tabs open (links, popups), like Chrome tab groups. Tabs you open or drag into the MCP window are off limits. Tab and window IDs live in session storage, so a restart never hands Claude one of your tabs. |
| **Network log scope** | `read_network_requests` data is only collected for Claude's tabs. |
| **http(s) only** | `navigate` refuses `javascript:`, `data:`, `file:`, `about:`, `moz-extension:` and other non-web URLs. |
| **Authenticated local channel** | A random secret is created at `~/.config/open-claude-in-firefox/auth-token` (mode `0600`). The MCP server, client MCP servers, and the native host prove they know it with an HMAC challenge-response **in both directions**, so other local users or programs can't drive your browser through the TCP port, and a program squatting on the port can't impersonate the MCP server. The secret is never sent over the socket. |

Dialogs that get no answer within 2 minutes count as **Deny**, and so does closing the dialog.

High-risk detection is heuristic (it looks at the element being clicked or typed into), so it can't catch everything. Prompt injection, where a web page hides instructions aimed at Claude, is still the main risk of any browser agent. Consider using a dedicated Firefox profile that isn't signed in to your most sensitive accounts.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** v18+
- **Firefox** 115+
- **Claude Code** v2.0.73+ and/or **Claude Desktop**

### Step 1: Install dependencies

```bash
cd host
npm ci --ignore-scripts
cd ..
```

### Step 2: Load the extension in Firefox

1. Open `about:debugging` in Firefox
2. Click **This Firefox**
3. Click **Load Temporary Add-on...**
4. Select `extension/manifest.json`

> **Permanent install**: Go to `about:addons` → gear icon → **Install Add-on From File** and select `extension/manifest.json`. Or load the `.xpi` if one is provided.

Unlike Chrome, Firefox assigns the extension ID from `manifest.json` (`open-claude-in-firefox@anthropic`), so you don't need to pass an ID to the install script.

### Step 3: Register the native messaging host

#### macOS / Linux

```bash
./install.sh
```

#### Windows (manual)

Firefox on Windows finds native messaging hosts via the registry. Three steps:

**3a.** Create a wrapper script at `host\native-host-wrapper.bat`:

```bat
@echo off
node "%~dp0native-host.js"
```

**3b.** Create the manifest at `host\com.anthropic.open_claude_in_firefox.json` (use the actual absolute path):

```json
{
  "name": "com.anthropic.open_claude_in_firefox",
  "description": "Open Claude in Firefox Native Messaging Host",
  "path": "C:\\path\\to\\open-claude-in-firefox\\host\\native-host-wrapper.bat",
  "type": "stdio",
  "allowed_extensions": ["open-claude-in-firefox@anthropic"]
}
```

**3c.** Register it in the registry. Run in PowerShell (adjust the path):

```powershell
$manifestPath = "C:\path\to\open-claude-in-firefox\host\com.anthropic.open_claude_in_firefox.json"
New-Item -Path "HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\NativeMessagingHosts\com.anthropic.open_claude_in_firefox" -Force |
  Set-ItemProperty -Name "(Default)" -Value $manifestPath
```

### Step 4: Restart Firefox

Close **all** Firefox windows and reopen. Firefox reads native messaging host configs on startup.

### Step 5: Add to Claude Code

```bash
claude mcp add open-claude-in-firefox -- node /absolute/path/to/host/mcp-server.js
```

Find the absolute path with:

```bash
# macOS / Linux
echo "node $(pwd)/host/mcp-server.js"

# Windows (PowerShell)
"node $(Resolve-Path host\mcp-server.js)"
```

### Step 5 (alternative): Add to Claude Desktop

Edit your Claude Desktop config file and add an `mcpServers` entry:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "open-claude-in-firefox": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/host/mcp-server.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

Fully quit and restart Claude Desktop after saving.

## Verification

Start a new Claude Code (or Claude Desktop) session and test:

```
Navigate to reddit.com and take a screenshot
```

Reddit loads. No domain restriction.

## Available Tools

All 18 tools, matching the Claude in Chrome interface:

| Tool | Description |

## Firefox Notes

### Tab groups → MCP window

The Chrome version uses tab groups to track Claude's tabs. Firefox has no tab groups API, so this extension instead opens a dedicated **MCP window**. All tabs Claude creates live in that window. Claude can only control the tabs it created (and tabs they open), not every tab in the window. These IDs are kept in `storage.session`, so they survive a background-script reload but are cleared when Firefox restarts.

### Synthetic events

Firefox WebExtensions cannot use the Chrome DevTools Protocol. Mouse clicks, keyboard input, and scrolling are dispatched as synthetic DOM events from a content script. These events have `isTrusted: false`, which means:

- Most web apps work fine — synthetic events are standard practice for testing frameworks
- A small number of hardened apps check `event.isTrusted` and ignore synthetic events; those interactions will fail silently

### Screenshots

`tabs.captureVisibleTab()` can only capture the active tab in a window. The extension automatically activates the target tab before each screenshot. If the MCP window is in the background, the tab switch is invisible since Firefox doesn't require the window to be focused.

### Console monitoring

Console messages are captured via a MAIN-world interceptor injected into the page. Messages logged **before** `read_console_messages` is first called on a tab are not captured. Call `read_console_messages` early in a session to start capturing.

## Updating After Code Changes

No build step. All files are plain JavaScript. After pulling or editing:

| What changed | What to do |
|---|---|
| `extension/background.js`, `content.js`, or `manifest.json` | Reload: `about:debugging` → click the reload icon next to the extension |
| `host/mcp-server.js` | Kill stale servers and reconnect: `pkill -f "node.*mcp-server"` then `/mcp` in Claude Code |
| `host/native-host.js` | Restart Firefox (close all windows, reopen) |
| `install.sh` or native host name changed | Re-run `./install.sh`, restart Firefox, re-add MCP |
| `host/auth.js` (channel authentication) | Restart Firefox **and** kill/reconnect MCP servers. All three processes must run the same version or connections are rejected. |

### Quick reset

If things are broken and you're not sure why:

```bash
# 1. Kill all MCP servers
pkill -f "node.*mcp-server"

# 2. Re-run install
./install.sh

# 3. Restart Firefox (close all windows, reopen)

# 4. Reload extension in about:debugging

# 5. Reconnect in Claude Code
# /mcp
```

## Multiple Sessions

Multiple Claude Code sessions can share the same browser extension. The first session becomes the "primary" (owns the TCP port), and subsequent sessions connect as clients through the primary.

If a session disconnects, kill stale servers and reconnect:

```bash
pkill -f "node.*mcp-server"
# then /mcp in each Claude Code session
```

## Troubleshooting

### Extension not connecting

1. Verify the extension is loaded and enabled in `about:debugging`
2. Make sure `./install.sh` completed without errors (macOS/Linux) or the registry key is set (Windows)
3. Restart Firefox completely (all windows closed)
4. Verify the native messaging manifest exists:
   - **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Mozilla/NativeMessagingHosts/com.anthropic.open_claude_in_firefox.json`
   - **Linux**: `~/.mozilla/native-messaging-hosts/com.anthropic.open_claude_in_firefox.json`
   - **Windows**: check `HKCU\SOFTWARE\Mozilla\NativeMessagingHosts\com.anthropic.open_claude_in_firefox` in the registry

### MCP server not found

Use an absolute path:
```bash
claude mcp add open-claude-in-firefox -- node /absolute/path/to/host/mcp-server.js
```

### "Browser extension is not connected"

The MCP server started but the native host hasn't connected. Try:
1. Open any webpage in the MCP window (wakes the service worker)
2. Check service worker logs: `about:debugging` → Inspect the extension's service worker
3. Verify `host/native-host-wrapper.sh` (macOS/Linux) or `host/native-host-wrapper.bat` (Windows) exists and is executable

### Tools fail immediately after reconnect

Stale MCP server processes from previous sessions may be holding the port:

```bash
pkill -f "node.*mcp-server"
```

Then `/mcp` in Claude Code to reconnect.

### "failed authentication" / "Rejected unauthenticated TCP connection"

The MCP server and native host must run the same version and read the same secret.
1. Make sure both run as the same OS user (they read `~/.config/open-claude-in-firefox/auth-token`)
2. Kill old servers (`pkill -f "node.*mcp-server"`), restart Firefox, and reconnect with `/mcp`
3. If it persists, another program may be using the port. Check with `lsof -i :18765` and/or change the port (below)

To rotate the secret, delete `auth-token`, then restart Firefox and the MCP servers.

### Permission dialog didn't appear

Dialogs open as small popup windows. Check whether one is hidden behind other windows. Unanswered dialogs are denied after 2 minutes, and Claude is told not to retry.

### Port conflict

Default port is 18765. To change:
1. Create `~/.config/open-claude-in-firefox/config.json`:
   ```json
   { "port": 19000 }
   ```
2. Restart Firefox and Claude Code
